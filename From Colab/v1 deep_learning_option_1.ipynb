A Monte Carlo simulation needs millions of paths to get an accurate answer which is computationally intensive. [Ryan et al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02233) showed that a deep learning model can be trained to value derivatives. The deep learning model is accurate and very fast, capable of producing valuations a million times faster than traditional models. In the this notebook, we will use a fully connected network to learn the pricing mode of the Asian Barrier option. Monte Carlo simulation is used as pricing ground truth for the training. We use the same Asian Barrier Option model as last notebook with parameters listed as following:\n","\n","```\n","T - Maturity (yrs.)\n","S - Spot (usd)\n","K - Strike (usd)\n","sigma - Volatility (per.)\n","r - Risk Free Rate (per.)\n","mu - Stock Drift Rate (per.)\n","B - Barrier (usd)\n","```\n","\n","### Batched Data generation\n","\n","The dataset is an important part of the Deep learning training. We will modify the previous single Asian Barrier Option pricing code to handle a batch of Barrier Option pricing. \n","\n","Loading all the necessary libraries:-"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rmLieKk5M0wC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622129816748,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":14432,"user":{"displayName":"Pui Ieng Lei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiUxB62djaXyekhwBWrALyZjUPepPF_29I1tV5i=s64","userId":"03446030301916229832"}},"outputId":"4f629fa0-ccec-40f6-9b80-138fadf3b71e"},"source":["!curl https://colab.chainer.org/install |sh -\n","import cupy"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100  1580  100  1580    0     0   5249      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  5266\n","+ apt -y -q install cuda-libraries-dev-10-0\n","Reading package lists...\n","Building dependency tree...\n","Reading state information...\n","cuda-libraries-dev-10-0 is already the newest version (10.0.130-1).\n","The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:\n","  libnvidia-common-460\n","Use 'apt autoremove' to remove it.\n","0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 34 not upgraded.\n","+ pip install -q cupy-cuda100  chainer \n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 58.9MB 81kB/s \n","\u001b[?25h+ set +ex\n","Installation succeeded!\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IF6DPA5OEYuw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622129849914,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2270,"user":{"displayName":"Pui Ieng Lei","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiUxB62djaXyekhwBWrALyZjUPepPF_29I1tV5i=s64","userId":"03446030301916229832"}}},"source":["import cupy\n","import numpy as np\n","import math\n","import time\n","import torch\n","cupy.cuda.set_allocator(None)\n","from torch.utils.dlpack import from_dlpack"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M43-u7-0EYuw"},"source":["The CuPy version of batched barrier option pricing simulation is as follows:-"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QChqz4N5EYuw"},"source":["cupy_batched_barrier_option = cupy.RawKernel(r'''\n","extern \"C\" __global__ void batched_barrier_option(\n","    float *d_s,\n","    const float T,\n","    const float * K,\n","    const float * B,\n","    const float * S0,\n","    const float * sigma,\n","    const float * mu,\n","    const float * r,\n","    const float * d_normals,\n","    const long N_STEPS,\n","    const long N_PATHS,\n","    const long N_BATCH)\n","{\n","  unsigned idx =  threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;\n","  unsigned stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;\n","  unsigned tid = threadIdx.x;\n","  const float tmp3 = sqrt(T/N_STEPS);\n","\n","\n","  for (unsigned i = idx; i<N_PATHS * N_BATCH; i+=stride)\n","  {\n","    int batch_id = i / N_PATHS;\n","    int path_id = i % N_PATHS;\n","    float s_curr = S0[batch_id];\n","    float tmp1 = mu[batch_id]*T/N_STEPS;\n","    float tmp2 = exp(-r[batch_id]*T);\n","    unsigned n=0;\n","    double running_average = 0.0;\n","    for(unsigned n = 0; n < N_STEPS; n++){\n","       s_curr += tmp1 * s_curr + sigma[batch_id]*s_curr*tmp3*d_normals[path_id + batch_id * N_PATHS + n * N_PATHS * N_BATCH];\n","       running_average += (s_curr - running_average) / (n + 1.0);\n","       if (running_average <= B[batch_id]){\n","           break;\n","       }\n","    }\n","\n","    float payoff = (running_average>K[batch_id] ? running_average-K[batch_id] : 0.f); \n","    d_s[i] = tmp2 * payoff;\n","  }\n","}\n","\n","''', 'batched_barrier_option')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pxm-wwZTEYux"},"source":["Note, the parameters (K, B, S0, sigma, mu, r) are passed in as an array with length of batch size.
